## Spinning Solar System


</div>

### Description

Using the rmcontrol ocx, it displays full screen a

sun and planets revolving around it. The bmps were cut

from pictures at the Public Domain site, NSSDC Photo Gallery

who asks that the are recognized as the source of any use of

their pictures. The water planet and water planet with green

came from the planet-source-code.com (A 3d spinning world

with text) by Dustin Davis whose original source code is the

foundation of this sample). Any of the planets bmps not

already mentioned came from Yohkoh Public Outreach Project,

another public domain site). The solid color bmps were created

with my handy/dandy MS. Paint Program. The truth be known, as

an artist, I would starve.

The reason that I used so many timers to change

the background is that each "star" is a bmp and

any changes to more than 4 "stars" at a time causes

degradation in the motion of the planets.

If anyone could tell me how to paste a starfield into

the backgroound instead of having to code each star, I

would certainly appreciate it.
 
### More Info
 
You must obtain the rmcontrol.ocx to run this

program. As my understanding, it came with

directx7 and is on Planet-source-code.com.
