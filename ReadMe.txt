Three of the bmps have pieces cut from the Public Domain site, NSSDC Photo Gallery who asks that the are recognized
as the source of any use of their pictures.  The water planet and water planet with green came from the planet-source-code
.com (A 3d spinning world with text) by Dustin Davis whose original source code is the foundation of this sample). Any of
the planets bmps not already mentioned came from Yohkoh Public Outreach Project.  The solid color bmps were created 
with my handy/dandy MS. Paint Program.  

This code is a tribute to the cooperation and sharing of source code by programmers and sites like www.planet-source-code.com
which supply the place to store the source code.
